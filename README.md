# Sentiment-Analysis

Yelp dataset: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1CroF43Yasx_14nW2u6jABI3pK01_Y5gr  

No of reviews: 6.6M

## Data preprocessing
1. Remove stop words
2. Stemming/Lemmetization
3. Uppercase to Lowercase
4. Removing any bad characters like \n, \t, $ etc using regex.

As the data size is large it would be slow to run on a cpu with low specs. GPU is highly recommended (cloud).
